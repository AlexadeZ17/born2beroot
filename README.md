# born2beroot üêß

This project, part of Rank 01 of 42's common core consists on creating our very first web server from scratch, with no graphical envirnment.

The requirements of the project are the following:

- No graphical environment
- Only port 4242 is open, with service SSH and with UFW Firewall activated to only allow connections to that port
- Root SSH connection is not enabled
- A strong password Policy must be implemented
- Create a cronjob that runs a script that shows relevant information about our computer

As a bonus, we also had to:

- Implement wordpress with MariaDB, PHP and ligthttp
- Implement another service, exluding nginx and Apache2

The way the project was evaluated was by answering questions from evaluators in order to asses our understanding of the exercice and the solution. This repo will serve as a manual where I'll be explaining step by step what I did to succesfully pass this project
