# SSH

SSH stands for "Secur Shell", and it's a way to communicate to a computer remotely through an encrypted shell. It usually opperates on port 22, but this assignment requires us to configure it on port 4242.

The SSH server I'll be using is OpenSSH, which is pre-installed on the Debian Image I chose.

Executing ``sudo service ssh status`` reveals information about the server, including in which port it's running
